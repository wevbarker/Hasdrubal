Print@"Ah, so the Poisson bracket between the primary and secondary constraints is non-vanishing. Since there are only two constraints in total, this means that both constraints are second class. We have now found and classified all the constraints in the theory. To summarise, the theory has two constraints in total: one primary and one secondary. Both constraints are second class. The total number of canonical degrees of freedom in the theory is 2*(1+3), where the 2 is from the field-momentum pairs, and the (1+3) is from the 0p and 1m components of the vector field. From this we subtract 1 degree of freedom for the primary constraint, and another degree of freedom for the secondary constraint, leaving us with 2*(1+3)-2=6 canonical degrees of freedom, or equivalently 3 physical degrees of freedom.";
