Once you have read the information below, you should proceed directly with the algorithm.\n\nHere is a Wolfram Language statement of the total Hamiltonian. That is, the Legendre-transformed Lagrangian, plus multiplier fields times constraints, in which the field velocities have been replaced by momenta where possible, and by Lagrange multipliers where not.\n\n```mathematica\n(Coupling83fc4bdd*Field2a3728e5[]^2)/2 - ConjugateMomentumField2a3728e5[]^2/Coupling750dbd1c - (Coupling83fc4bdd*Field37d48fd1[-a]*Field37d48fd1[a])/2 + ConjugateMomentumField37d48fd1[-a]*Field37d48fd1LagrangeMultiplier[a] + ConjugateMomentumField2a3728e5[]*CD[-a][Field37d48fd1[a]]\n```\n\nHere is a Wolfram Language statement of all the constant symbols that appear in the total Hamiltonian above.\n\n```mathematica\n{Coupling750dbd1c, Coupling83fc4bdd}\n```\n\nHere is a Wolfram Language list of the canonical fields used in the Hamiltonian formulation.
