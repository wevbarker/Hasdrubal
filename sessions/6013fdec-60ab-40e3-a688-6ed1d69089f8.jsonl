Once you have read the information below, you should proceed directly with the algorithm.\n\nHere is a Wolfram Language statement of the total Hamiltonian. That is, the Legendre-transformed Lagrangian, plus multiplier fields times constraints, in which the field velocities have been replaced by momenta where possible, and by Lagrange multipliers where not.\n\n```mathematica\n(CouplingConstante5f53ecd*CanonicalFieldccb6bb11[]^2)/2 - ConjugateMomentumCanonicalFieldccb6bb11[]^2/CouplingConstant750dbd1c - (CouplingConstante5f53ecd*CanonicalField1ea68330[-a]*CanonicalField1ea68330[a])/2 + ConjugateMomentumCanonicalField1ea68330[-a]*LagrangeMultiplier1ea68330[a] + ConjugateMomentumCanonicalFieldccb6bb11[]*CD[-a][CanonicalField1ea68330[a]]\n```\n\nHere is a Wolfram Language statement of all the constant symbols that appear in the total Hamiltonian above.\n\n```mathematica\n{CouplingConstant750dbd1c, CouplingConstante5f53ecd}\n```\n\nHere is a Wolfram Language list of the canonical fields used in the Hamiltonian formulation.

Wait for the user to confirm whether you should proceed with that step, and then continue step-by-step from there.\n\n"}
