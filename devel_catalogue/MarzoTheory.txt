This prompt provides all the information needed to implement the Dirac-Bergman Hamiltonian constraint algorithm for a specific theory. Once you have read the information below, you should proceed directly with the algorithm.
Here is a Wolfram Language statement of the total Hamiltonian. That is, the Legendre-transformed Lagrangian, plus multiplier fields times constraints, in which the field velocities have been replaced by momenta where possible, and by Lagrange multipliers where not.

Here is a Wolfram Language statement of all the constant symbols that appear in the total Hamiltonian above.

Here is a Wolfram Language list of the canonical fields used in the Hamiltonian formulation. Some of these fields may not appear in the total Hamiltonian above.
{xAct`PSALTer`VectorField`Rank10p[], xAct`PSALTer`VectorField`Rank11m[-a]}
Here is a Wolfram Language list of the conjugate momenta corresponding to the canonical fields above. Some of these momenta may not appear in the total Hamiltonian above.
{xAct`PSALTer`VectorField`Rank10pConjugateMomentum[], xAct`PSALTer`VectorField`Rank11mConjugateMomentum[a]}
Here is a Wolfram Language list of the Lagrange multiplier fields introduced to enforce the primary constraints in the Hamiltonian formulation. Some of these multipliers may not appear in the total Hamiltonian above.

This is the end of the provided information; you should tell me when you've read it, and then propose the first step to start implementing the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, in line with your earlier instructions about workflow. Wait for the user to confirm whether you should proceed with that step, and then continue step-by-step from there.
