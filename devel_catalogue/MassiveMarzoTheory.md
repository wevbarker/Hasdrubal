This prompt provides all the information needed to implement the Dirac-Bergman Hamiltonian constraint algorithm for a specific theory. Once you have read the information below, you should proceed directly with the algorithm.Here is a Wolfram Language statement of the total Hamiltonian. That is, the Legendre-transformed Lagrangian, plus multiplier fields times constraints, in which the field velocities have been replaced by momenta where possible, and by Lagrange multipliers where not.

Here is a Wolfram Language list of the canonical fields used in the Hamiltonian formulation. Some of these fields may not appear in the total Hamiltonian above.

Here is a Wolfram Language list of the conjugate momenta corresponding to the canonical fields above. Some of these momenta may not appear in the total Hamiltonian above.
