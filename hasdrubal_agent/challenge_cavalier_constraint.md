# SYSTEM CHALLENGE

**Why this message was triggered** Your last message made reference to `DefTensor`.

**Why this message is important** It is possible that you are planning to use `DefTensor` in your next step. One of the reasons for using `DefTensor` might be to define a new constraint. As described in your system prompt, it is important to double-check that any constraint you are defining is necessary and correctly formulated. This means taking into account the possibility of gradients in velocities, duplicate constraints, and equations that may be soluble for multipliers. This step requires careful reasoning. Alternatively, this could be a false alarm: you may not be planning to use `DefTensor` immediately, or you may be planning to use it to define a non-constraint object (such as a smearing function or a multiplier field).

**If this is a false alarm** Treat this SYSTEM CHALLENGE as a "yes" from the user in response to your last reply.

**If this is not a false alarm** Please revise your last message to include the appropriate tool calls, and frame your new response as "yes"/"no" question as usual.
