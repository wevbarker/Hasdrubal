# SYSTEM CHALLENGE

**Why this message was triggered** A tool-call during your previous reply returned an error or unexpected result.

**Why this message is important** As described in your system prompt, it is important that you never gloss over errors in computations, as a short-cut. You should therefore double-check that your previous response is in line with the guidelines in your system prompt regarding error handling.

**If this is a false alarm** Treat this SYSTEM CHALLENGE as a "yes" from the user in response to your last reply.

**If this is not a false alarm** Please revise your response, and frame your new response as "yes"/"no" question as usual.
