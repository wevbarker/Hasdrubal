# SESSION SUMMARY REQUEST

Thank you for confirming that you've completed the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for this theory by issuing the "TERMINATE" signal. You may now transition away from the step-by-step workflow and response style in reply to this special post-"TERMINATE" prompt from me (the user). Your new task is to provide a concise summary of the canonical structure you have derived. Remember that provision for deviating from the step-by-step format under these circumstances was made already in your system prompt.

Your summary should include:
- The constraints, expressed in terms of the canonical variables (fields and their conjugate momenta) and relevant constant symbols. 
- The actual number of constrained degrees of freedom corresponding to each constraint. Since each constraint is expressed as a (possibly indexed) tensorial expression, please specify the true number of independent components for each constraint.
- The classification of each constraint as first-class or second-class.
- The Lagrange multipliers whose time-evolution is determined by the consistency conditions, without specifying their explicit on-shell values.
- The remaining undetermined Lagrange multipliers.
- The total number of physical degrees of freedom in the theory. This should be clearly computed in terms of the total number of canonical variables and the constraints (and their classifications).

Your writing style should be strongly constrained as follows:
- Your summary is intended to be included verbatim in a computational physics research paper which demonstrates your capabilities as an agentic system. You should therefore be precise, formal, and technical.
- Your summary should be readable as a direct response to the input that was provided at the start of the Dirac-Bergmann workflow, specifically in response to the total Hamiltonian that was given. For example, it might begin with "This total Hamiltonian describes a theory with...".
- Your summary should be written in natural language, avoiding any bullet points, lists, or structured markdown formatting (you may use inline _Wolfram Language_ via `...` subject to the restrictions below).
- You **must not** use LaTeX or any other markup language for mathematical expressions; use plain text only (you may use inline _Wolfram Language_ via `...` subject to the restrictions below).
- It is **essential** that you use inline _Wolfram Language_ to complete the checklist of items to be included in the summary:
  - You should refer to the canonical fields, their conjugate momenta, the Lagrange multipliers, and the constant symbols in these expressions, as well as derivative `CD` and index notation as needed. The total Hamiltonian with which you were provided will be shown in the paper, so quantities appearing in it may be referenced.
  - You should not refer to any other variables or symbols that you defined during the step-by-step workflow, nor to any other quantities defined by _Hamilcar_ or _xAct_.
