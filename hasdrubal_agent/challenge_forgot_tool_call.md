# SYSTEM CHALLENGE

**Why this message was triggered** You just replied without making any actual tool calls.

**Why this message is important** As described in your system prompt, you are typically expected to interact with the _Wolfram_ kernel via tool calls. You should double-check whether you intended to execute code but forgot to make the tool call. Alternatively, this could be a false alarm: you may have intended to respond without making any tool calls.

**If this is a false alarm** Treat this SYSTEM CHALLENGE as a "yes" from the user in response to your last reply.

**If this is not a false alarm** Please revise your response, and frame your new response as "yes"/"no" question as usual.
